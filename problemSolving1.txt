Communicate just with a flashlight without any code or similar method should be just to teel a simply information to the others.

example :
A couple diver who dive at night using flashlight to teel their partner where their partner is in the dark, or tell something happen with their partner. Wihtout any code human brain can know what happen by the light from flashlight, it moving normal org unnormally so their partner can take action or something else.
